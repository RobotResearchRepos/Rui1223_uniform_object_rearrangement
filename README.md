# Robot Prehensile Rearrangement in Cluttered and Confined Spaces

### Project Description
This research project falls in the domain of uniform-shaped object rearrangement in cluttered and confined workspaces such as shelves, where overhand grasps are not possible. 
As a result, obot-object and object-object interactions occur frequently and have to be avoided so as to successfully complete a rearrangement task.
Therefore, it is a harder scenario than the widely-researched tabletop setups, where robot-object and object-object interactions can be simplified or even waived.
